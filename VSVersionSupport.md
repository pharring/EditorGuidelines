# Editor Guidelines support for older Visual Studio versions.

Version 2.2.5 of Editor Guidelines will be the last version with support for Visual Studio 2012 and 2013.
Future versions will require Visual Studio 2015 or above.
For continued support of older versions we will publish an archived version of Editor Guidelines under a new name. When that extension is available, we'll provide a link here.
